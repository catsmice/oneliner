curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/debug/repair-backlinks | jq '{success: 
.success, repaired: .data.summary.backLinksRepaired, processed: 
.data.summary.socialPostsProcessed}'

psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as empty_postid_count FROM 
\"GeneratedPost\" WHERE \"postId\" IS NULL OR \"postId\" = '';"

Output:
Command 1: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/debug/repair-backlinks | jq '{success: .success, repaired: .data.summary.backLinksRepaired, processed: .data.summary.socialPostsProcessed}'

Command 2: psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as empty_postid_count FROM \"GeneratedPost\" WHERE \"postId\" IS NULL OR \"postId\" = '';"
